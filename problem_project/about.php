                            <p>E-Store was started on 4 February 2010 as a daily deals platform, but expanded in September 
                                2011 to become an online marketplace. Snapdeal has grown to become one of the largest 
                                online marketplace in India offering an assortment of 1 million products across diverse 
                                categories from over 10,000 sdfsellers, shipping to more than 500 towns and cities in 
                                India. In March 2015, Snapdeal brought actor Aamir Khan for the promotion of its website in 
                                India.</p><br>
                            <p>In August 2016, rumors surfaced through a VCCircle exclusive article that Snapdeal was considering 
                                possibilities of mergers with its bigger rivals Flipkart and Amazon. However, no confirmation 
                                has yet been given with Snapdeal vehemently denying the claims.Although there is a possibility 
                                of acquisition of Snapdeal by Flipkart, the company may have to deal with the Reserve Bank of 
                                India rules on Foreign Exchange to protect the interest of E-Store shareholders.</p><br>
                            <p>In the year 2012-13, E-Store had said that it expected revenues of about ₹600 crore (US$93 million).
                                Betting big on the growth of mobile commerce, Kunal Bahl, the CEO, said at the time that 15-20 per 
                                cent of the sales on Snapdeal came through m-commerce. E-store.com expected the total sale of products 
                                traded on its platform to cross ₹2,000 crore (US$310 million) in the fiscal year 2013-14 helped by its 
                                robust growth in the past two years and the growing popularity of e-commerce in India.</p>
